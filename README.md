hey,

Thanks for reading this and playing the game.
First, I hope you enjoy it - try not to ragequit too much.

You are free to copy this game to share it. I appreciate it.

But be careful, the game contains 3 files: 
a folder containing all of the data, the actual application, 
and this Readme. in order to play the game you need both the
application and the folder on the same level of your computer.

In other words, if you make a shortcut on your desktop, you need both to play.

Also, for those of you who are cheaters, ragequiters, or just lazy, click on the bottom 
left of your screen when playing a level. :)

If you have any suggestions you can contact me at Jack17Davis@gmail.com or in person too.

Lastly, thanks to Sean Costello for testing and giving me some ideas when I was stuck.
